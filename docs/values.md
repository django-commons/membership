Django Commons seeks to embody the following values. These are central to the organization’s existence and influence how we make decisions. These are listed in alphabetical order.

## Inclusivity

The community seeks to be welcoming, kind, inclusive and diverse. Any person who embodies the values of Django Commons is welcome in the community and should be treated with respect.

## Knowledge Sharing

The community seeks to openly share information about all areas it is involved in so that others can easily adopt them. Information can be on community organizing, package maintenance or sharing code.

## Stewardship

The community seeks to uphold high standards of professionalism in its work and interactions, treating others with respect, and being responsible stewards of open-source resources. This includes being reliable, following through on commitments, and maintaining ethical standards in both code and community engagement.

## Sustainability

The community seeks to make contributing to open source and the community itself a sustainable activity. This involves clear expectations on roles, being supportive of taking breaks and creating space for others. Our processes and code should be documented, be maintainable and easily searchable.

## Transparency

The community seeks to be transparent with its decisions and processes. Being open about operations allows for greater knowledge sharing, inclusivity and makes the community sustainable.
