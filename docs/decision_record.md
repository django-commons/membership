## Decisions

- 2025-11-21: Remove the Security team.
  There is little regular support from the team currently. The new process will be the
  admins will be notified of a security advisory and then they can reach out to community 
  members based on the context of the issue.
- 2025-10-10: Create "operations" team.
  Create an "operations" team for people with elevated permissions across GitHub and
  PyPI to allow new-to-Django-community people become admins.
- 2025-10-10: Retire PyPI team in favor of all admins
- 2025-10-10: 2025 admin team reaffirmations.
  Admin team reaffirmed status for next year if we increase the size of the team,
  otherwise people are interested in switching with new people.
- 2025-10-10: Finalized selection of the new Django Commons logo.
  [PR](https://github.com/django-commons/membership/pull/304)
- 2024-11-01: Retain project admins as PyPI Owners.
  The repository's admins will be retained as PyPI Owners. This provides the project team
  greater autonomy and allows a repository to be moved out of Django Commons without the
  admins involvement in extreme cases.
